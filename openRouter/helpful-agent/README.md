🚀 What is OpenRouter?
OpenRouter is a unified API gateway that gives you seamless access to a wide range of AI language models — like OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Mistral, Meta LLaMA, and more — all through a single API or web interface.

⚙️ How It Works
OpenRouter simplifies working with large language models by acting as a central hub:

Aggregates multiple models from different providers into one platform.

Offers a standardized API (compatible with OpenAI’s format) to interact with any model.

Allows easy switching between models by changing a single parameter (the model name).

Handles authentication and rate limits via a single API key.

Provides a web UI to chat with models directly, no code required.

✅ Benefits of Using OpenRouter
🔄 Multi-Model Access: Choose from a growing list of top LLMs without juggling multiple accounts.

🧠 Compare Easily: Benchmark outputs across different models with minimal code changes.

🧩 Plug-and-Play: Use OpenAI-compatible libraries like openai in Python with no major changes.

💸 Cost-Efficient: Find models that suit your performance and budget needs.

🛠️ Developer Friendly: Build faster with a unified, consistent API experience.

🌐 Open & Flexible: Supports both closed and open-source models.
