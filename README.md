🌐 What is uv?
uv is an ultra-fast Python package manager and environment manager built in Rust. It is designed to be a drop-in replacement for pip, pip-tools, and virtualenv, offering dramatically improved speed, reproducibility, and developer experience.

🚀 Why We Use uv in This Agent SDK
We use uv in this SDK to streamline Python environment and dependency management, especially in projects involving AI agents where setup speed and reproducibility are critical.

Benefits of using uv in the Agent SDK:

⚡ Blazing Fast Installs: uv installs dependencies much faster than traditional tools like pip or poetry, speeding up development and CI workflows.

📦 All-in-One Tooling: Combines virtual environment management, dependency resolution, and installation in a single CLI tool.

🔁 Reproducible Environments: Ensures consistent builds across different systems with precise lockfile support.

🧠 Ideal for AI Projects: Reduces overhead when setting up large AI/ML dependencies and helps keep agent environments clean and isolated.

📂 Simple Workflow: No need for multiple tools (pip, venv, pip-tools) — uv handles it all with a clean interface.

📌 Example
bash
Copy
Edit
# Install dependencies with uv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create and activate virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
